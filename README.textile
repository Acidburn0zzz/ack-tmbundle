Ack In Project:

This is highly experimental right now and not for public consumption.

The code is based on GrepInProject++ which was itself based on other's code as 
below:

# Adds search UI plus some minor modifications by Robert Thurnher &lt;http://soup.robert42.com&gt; 2007-08-11
# Note: put GrepInProjectSearch.nib into /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Support/nibs/
# Further modifications by Trevor Squires 

TODO:

There's much to fix here.  Right now it's completely hobbled to do a case 
sensitive search, demands that ack is in your search path, doesn't remember
your dialog settings (they are disabled anyhow right now) or last search
etc and last (but not least) displays a honking great output window when
the dialog is visible.

I've got fixes planned for all those to come in the next few days.

I'm not inviting any patches right now because the overall layout of the
source is going to drastically change pretty much immediately.

So, if you're reading this, prepare yourself for the fact that stuff *will*
change.
