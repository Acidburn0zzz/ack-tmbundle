Ack Textmate Bundle.
Version 0.0.0 (code named "leave me alone")

This is highly experimental right now and not for public consumption.

<h2>Installation</h2>

* Run this:
 
<pre>
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
git clone git://github.com/protocool/ack-tmbundle.git Ack.tmbundle
</pre>

<h2>Background</h2>

The code is based on GrepInProject++ which was itself based on other's code as below:

# Adds search UI plus some minor modifications by Robert Thurnher &lt;http://soup.robert42.com&gt; 2007-08-11
# Note: put GrepInProjectSearch.nib into /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Support/nibs/
# Further modifications by Trevor Squires 
</pre>

<h2>Outstanding issues</h2>

There's much to fix here.  Right now it's completely hobbled to do a case sensitive search, demands that ack is in your search path, doesn't remember your dialog settings (they are disabled anyhow right now) or last search etc and last (but not least) displays a honking great output window when the dialog is visible.

I've got fixes planned for all those to come in the next few days.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

I'm not inviting any patches right now because the overall layout of the source is going to drastically change pretty much immediately.

So, if you're reading this, prepare yourself for the fact that stuff *will* change.
